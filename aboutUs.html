      <p class="content">This service was inspired after an observation on how stressful it is these days especially with parents having a lot to do with time as a factor. There are situations where parents would have to take their children to school very early in the morning so they can also get to work in time. Children are also picked up late after they close and this can be tiring.<br> 
       Pick Me App takes this burden off parents by picking up your child to school and even after closing we bring them back to a destination provided to us by parents. <br>With Pick Me App your child is assured of a safe, comfortable and cheerful ride to and from school every single time.</p></div>
